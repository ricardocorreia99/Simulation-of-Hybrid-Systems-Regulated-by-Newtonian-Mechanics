# Simulation-of-Hybrid-Systems-Regulated-by-Newtonian-Mechanics

The evolution of software products that interact with the physical world has led to a greater need to simulate
their behavior in order to verify their effectiveness and safety in different scenarios. This dissertation project
aims to enhance a simulation tool for hybrid programs called Lince, more specifically to provide more
powerful simulation capabilities to hybrid programs regulated by Newtonian mechanics. These include the
addition of new language constructs (such as the division operator and the trigonometric functions), the
implementation of non-linear expressions, grammar relaxation and organization, improved error detection,
and the mitigation of existing tool-related issues.
Throughout this dissertation, it is discussed how the implementation of these improvements benefits
the simulation of hybrid programs and are explained the key methods adopted for their conception. Finally,
this new version of Lince is put to the test by handling case studies related to autonomous driving (for
example, adaptive cruise control and a missile targeting a moving object) and other types of systems
as well, such as purely physical systems and the so-called on-off systems. The results obtained in the
treatment of these case studies attest to the enhanced capabilities of this tool and the contribution of this
dissertation to the scientific community, demonstrating its relevance in simulating integrated systems in
everyday life.
